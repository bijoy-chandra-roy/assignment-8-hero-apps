# HERO Apps

## Description
HERO Apps is a simple client-side web app that mimics an app store, letting you browse, "install,” and "uninstall" apps, with all data stored in local storage. It’s built heavily with React Router, using multiple pages and components. There are three main pages, with a constant navbar and footer except on the error page, where a back button uses navigate(-1). The main content changes in the outlet based on the selected page from the navbar, using Link to navigate without reloading. Various states and hooks are used to add functionality like sorting, searching, and installing or uninstalling apps.I also made it dark mode compatible.
